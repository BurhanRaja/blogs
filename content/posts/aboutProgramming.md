We all have heard about these terms such as 'Computer Programming', 'Coding' etc. But exactly what is it, what it does, how do you do programming and many more questions. Here, in this blog post I am going to answer all your answers.

## What is a Programming?

Programming is nothing more than telling the computer to make it do work/tasks that is/are not possible for a human being to do in a small amount of time.

It is about solving real world problems that requires a lot of computation and calculation by giving a set of instructions to the computer to obtain an efficient solution.

It is what makes computers work. When you use softwares like an operating system, browser, app etc. are all developed using programming.

#### A simple example of instructions given to a computer

```
number1 = 80279008391
number2 = 64813671323

Sum of the two numbers

total = 80279008391 + 64813671323 = 145092679714
```

I had to calculate this total using calculator. &#128517;


## What is Programming used for?

Programming creates set of instructions for the computer to follow. It allows programmers to build programs that can create a beautiful websites or apps, written in javascript, kotlin etc.,  that you use nowadays. The games that you play like Fortnite, Pubg etc. are written a programming language called C++. The Operating Systmes that you use like windows, Linux are written in C/C++.

##### Whatever things you are using digitally, it is not possible to create/make them without a programming language.
